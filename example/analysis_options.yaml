# This file configures the static analysis results for your projects (errors,
# warnings, and lints).

# This enables the 'company' set of lints from `package:dart_company_lints`.
# This set helps identify many issues that may lead to problems when running
# or consuming Dart code, and enforces writing Dart using a single, idiomatic
# style and format.
